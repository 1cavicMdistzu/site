## Rustup
There are many ways to install Rust on your system. For the moment the official way to install Rust is using [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

[üìñ](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup#rustup-the-rust-toolchain-installer) Rustup installs The Rust Programming Language from the official release channels, enabling you to easily switch between **stable, beta, and nightly** compilers and keep them updated. It makes **cross-compiling** simpler with binary builds of the standard library for common platforms.

[üìñ](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup#installation) Rustup installs **`rustc`, `cargo`, `rustup`** and other standard tools to Cargo's `bin` directory. On Unix it is located at `$HOME/.cargo/bin` and on Windows at `%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin`. This is the same directory that `cargo install` will install Rust programs and Cargo plugins.

üí° More information can be found on the [Github repository of Rustup project](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup#rustup-the-rust-toolchain-installer).

### For Mac and Linux Users
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### For Windows Users
Download **`rustup-init.exe`** from [www.rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) and run.

> ‚≠ê If you are on **Microsoft Windows**, you have to install **[Visual C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)** 2015 or higher, which requires an additional 3‚Äì4 GBs.

## Before going to the next...

- To verify the current Rust version, use the **`rustc --version`** or **`rustc -V`** command.
- Rust ships releases on **six week cycles**. When a new Rust version released, use the **`rustup update`** command to update the Rust ecosystem.
- To open the offline Rust documentation, use the **`rustup doc`** command. For more `rustup` commands, check the **`rustup --help`** command.
